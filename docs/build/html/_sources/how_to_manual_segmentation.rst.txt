How to initiate a manual segmentation
=======================================

Some of the series may not be processed automatically as an autosegmentation template is not matching. Additionally you may want to apply a different template to a series which has been automatically segmented previously.

To initiate a manual segmentation, you need to follow the following steps:

#. Select the series from the list of series in the DICOM Series for Processing page.
#. Click on the dropdown menu in the Template File column and select the template that you want to apply to the series.
#. Click on the save button to save the template.
#. Click on the checkbox beside the series to select it.
#. Click on the button called Send Dicom for processing action.
#. The series will be sent for manual processing.
